                                                  Project Documentation for Library Management System
    introduction    
This project is a web-based library management system developed using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.
The library management system project aims to streamline the management of books and users within a library environment.
Designed for both librarians and members, it provides essential functionalities such as user registration, authentication, book management, and borrowing/returning books.
This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understand the system's architecture, technologies utilized, and how various features are implemented 

        
        Technology Stack    
Backend: Describe the technologies used for the server-side development (e.g., Flask, PostgreSQL).        
Frontend: Mention the technologies used for the client-side development (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).        
Deployment: Details about how the application is deployed (e.g., Railway for backend and database, GitHub Pages for frontend).        
APIs: Document the APIs used or created, including endpoints and data formats (e.g., JSON).    

    Architecture
The system architecture follows a client-server model, where the frontend communicates with the Flask-based backend via RESTful APIs. 
The backend handles requests from the frontend, processes data through SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions, and ensures seamless data flow between users and the stored book information.
The PostgreSQL database schema includes tables for users, books, and transactions, facilitating organized data management.
